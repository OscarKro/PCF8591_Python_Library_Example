# PCF8591_Python_Library_Example

This small repo is created for the Minor ICT for NON-ICT'ers from the university of applied siences Utrecht. 
The example has a PCF8591 class which contains some very basic code to read out (and optional write) data from the PCF8591 using Python. 
It is completely based on the library from Shudiamonds. See: https://github.com/ShuDiamonds/PCF8591. All credits for creating this code except for the example on the lower side of the document go to him/her. I only used his/her code to create a simple to use example and document for the minor students.
